## Overview

A lightweight micro-frontend  / micro-component solution inspired by [Portals](https://github.com/WICG/portals) proposal


## Feature

- âš¡ Blazing fast, based on [magic](https://github.com/bytedance/magic-microservices)
- ðŸš€ Portability: write your code and use it with any frameworks.
- ðŸ”¨ Adaptable: an adapter for any JS module, friendly to existing code.
- ðŸ’ª Web Components driven design

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install @magic-microservices/portal
# or
$ yarn add @magic-microservices/portal
```


### Register portal component

```typescript
import portal, { PortalHtmlEntryPlugin } from '@magic-microservices/portal'

await portal({
  plugins: [new PortalHtmlEntryPlugin()], // fetch and parse html
})
```

### Use built-in portal component ðŸŽ‰

Registration should be placed before instantiation. Portal html entry plugin uses fetch under the hood, 
make sure the corresponding website's CORS has configured.

```html
<magic-portal src='//some-where-you-want-to-go' />
```


## Advanced usage

### Manifest and extremely fast rendering experience

You may found the example above used `PortalHtmlEntryPlugin` to achieve HTML fetching and parsing at runtime, however in the best practice, this step should be avoided and moved to AOT(Ahead of Time) compilation. 
Manifest is a file that describes how HTML looks like (ie.`scripts` and `styles`), 
and we could use `PortalManifestWebpackPlugin` to generate that in compilation stage.

```typescript
import PortalManifestWebpackPlugin from '@magic-microservices/portal-manifest-webpack-plugin'

// webpack.config.js
plugins: [
  ...,
  new PortalManifestWebpackPlugin()
]
```

`PortalManifestWebpackPlugin` takes advantage of `html-webpack-plugin` under the hood. To use this plugin, make sure Webpack is using that.

After that, each Webpack build would generate a `manifest.json` which corresponding to your HTML and you could use this file directly in `magic-portal` just like this:

```html
<magic-portal manifest='//some-where/manifest.json' />
```
